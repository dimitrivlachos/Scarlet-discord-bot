# Scarlet AI
 
My very own discord bot!

## Setup
You will need to create another folder called 'config' and within it create a .bin file called 'token' and paste your bot token in there. You will also need to create a .bin file called 'open_weather' and paste your open weather api key in there.

You can use the text_to_bin.py file to convert your token and api key to a .bin file. By typing in the command line:
```python text_to_bin.py "Hello World" hello.bin```

## Commands
In order to use the commands you will need to prefix them with an @ mention of the bot. For example:
```@Scarlet weather 'city'```
### General
weather 'city' - Get the weather for a city
